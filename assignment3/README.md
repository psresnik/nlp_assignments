## Exploring syntactic analysis

The assignment is [here](parsing_problems.pdf). Do parsing problems 1 and 2.

You are also welcome to do optional extra credit, which makes use of code in this repository.

This assignment is due Monday April 12 at the start of class, 6pm ET.  This is not a long assignment, but given that the midterm is being handed out on Wednesday April 14, I strongly recommend getting an early start and turning it in on time if at all possible.
