## Project overview

***THIS PROJECT DESCRIPTION IS TENTATIVE. IT IS A GOOD THING TO READ THROUGH TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THE PROJECT IS LIKELY TO BE LIKE, BUT THERE COULD STILL BE CHANGES. WE WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN THE PROJECT PLANS ARE FINALIZED.***

--


**Groups.** You will be forming project groups of 3-4 people. If you are having trouble finding a group, let me know ASAP, and I will try to help put people together. 

**Goal.** The primary goal of the project is to give you a chance to get hands on a bit more deeply using ideas and methods that you've been learning this semester, taking approaches that are likely to be useful in the real world.  This will involve implementation of code, and it will also involve a thoughtful approach to data and the ability to do a good job writing up what you did.

**Scope.**  Given the timing, the project will have a fairly narrow and specific scope in terms of its *requirements*. However, groups are encouraged to go beyond the specifications here if they're feeling strongly motivated and capable.  That said, *the grade is going to be based on the writeup*, with an emphasis on demonstrating your understanding of the ideas and methods and thinking clearly and thoughtfully about the problem and the approaches you're taking.  This means that if you have a choice between doing one more thing experimentally, versus making sure the writeup is solid and well done, you should choose the latter.

**Due date.** The project will be due *6pm ET on May 17*.  Unfortunately there is no leeway here, because the powers that be have not provided a lot of time for grading.  You are welcome to turn the project in earlier if you'd like.

**Project options.**

There are two project options. They are essentially identical, in terms of what you need to do, differing only in the dataset you choose to work on and the format in which you'll receive the data.  The first option involves binary classification of social media status updates to classify users as positive or negative with respect to the personality trait of neuroticism.  The second option involves binary classification of users who have posted to r/SuicideWatch, an anonymous peer support forum on Reddit for people struggling with suicidal thoughts.  Your team can choose either project option.  

- Project option 1: [Prediction of personality traits ](project_personality.md)

- Project option 2: [Prediction of suicide risk in Reddit posts](project_sw.md).  If you are interested in this option:
	- Make sure you read the Caution at the top of the project description
	- Make sure you read "steps and how to write things up" in Project option 1
